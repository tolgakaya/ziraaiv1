**Branch:** `feature/sponsor-package-purchase-flow`
**Status:** ✅ Specification Complete, Ready for Implementation

## 📋 What Was Delivered

### Problem Statement

**User Request:** "satın alma flowunda bunu satın almayı yapacak sponsora göstermek ve seçim yapmasını sağlamak gerek. Onun için soruyorum. Bu bilgiler sadece dokümentasyonda kayıtlı bu kısıtların ve paket yeteneklerinin müşteriye nasıl seçim için sunulacağını yorumlayabilir misin?"

**Translation:** Need to present tier options with their constraints and capabilities to sponsors during purchase flow to enable selection.

---

## 🎯 Solution Overview

I've interpreted the documented tier constraints and capabilities into a structured API response and UI specification that enables sponsors to:

1. **Compare tiers side-by-side** with clear feature differentiation
2. **Understand sponsorship-specific benefits** (not just subscription features)
3. **See data access percentages** (30%/60%/100%) explicitly
4. **Visualize logo visibility rules** per screen type
5. **Identify communication capabilities** (messaging in L/XL)
6. **Recognize Smart Links exclusivity** (XL tier only)

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### 1. Comprehensive Specification Document ✅
**File:** `claudedocs/TIER_SELECTION_UI_SPECIFICATION.md`

**Contents:**
- Complete tier feature matrix (S/M/L/XL breakdown)
- Enhanced API response structure
- Mobile UI/UX recommendations (Flutter)
- Web UI/UX recommendations (Angular/React)
- Side-by-side tier comparison design

**Key Insight:** Extracted 17+ feature categories from documentation into structured comparison format suitable for UI display.

---

### 2. Data Transfer Objects ✅
**File:** `Entities/Dtos/SponsorshipTierComparisonDto.cs`

**DTOs Created:**
- `SponsorshipTierComparisonDto` - Main container for tier comparison
- `SponsorshipFeaturesDto` - Sponsorship-specific features
- `FarmerDataAccessDto` - What sponsor can see (30%/60%/100%)
- `LogoVisibilityDto` - Where logo appears (screen-by-screen)
- `CommunicationFeaturesDto` - Messaging capabilities (L/XL only)
- `SmartLinksFeaturesDto` - Smart links quota (XL exclusive: 50)
- `SupportFeaturesDto` - Support tier and response times

**Key Feature:** Separates sponsorship features from subscription features, making it clear what sponsors get vs what farmers get.

---

### 3. Implementation Plan ✅
**File:** `claudedocs/TIER_SELECTION_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Contents:**
- Step-by-step backend implementation guide
- Service layer implementation (`SponsorshipTierMappingService`)
- Controller endpoint specification (`GET /api/v1/sponsorship/tiers-for-purchase`)
- Frontend integration examples (Flutter models & widgets)
- Testing strategy (unit + integration tests)
- Complete checklists for backend and frontend teams

**Key Mapping Logic:** Tier name (S/M/L/XL) → Sponsorship features based on documented constraints.

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Separate Endpoint vs Enhanced Existing

**Decision:** Create NEW endpoint `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/tiers-for-purchase`
**Rationale:**
- Existing `/api/v1/subscriptions/tiers` is for farmers (subscription focus)
- New endpoint is for sponsors (sponsorship focus)
- Different audience = different DTO structure
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### 2. Tier Feature Mapping

**Decision:** Service layer maps tier name → features programmatically
**Rationale:**
- Features are tier-specific and well-documented
- No need for database storage (derived from tier name)
- Single source of truth: documentation + code
- Easy to maintain and update

**Mapping Source:** `SPONSOR_PERSONA_COMPLETE_JOURNEY_REPORT.md` lines 1186-1245 (constraint matrix)

### 3. Data Access Percentage

**Decision:** Explicit `dataAccessPercentage` field (30/60/100)
**Rationale:**
- Clear visual indicator for UI (progress bars, percentages)
- Easy for sponsors to understand value progression
- Documented in persona report as key differentiator

### 4. Logo Visibility as List

**Decision:** `visibleScreens: ["Start Screen", "Result Screen", ...]`
**Rationale:**
- Easy for mobile UI to display as chips/tags
- Human-readable screen names
- Progressive enhancement visualization (1 → 2 → 4 screens)

### 5. AllowAnonymous Endpoint

**Decision:** No authentication required for tier listing
**Rationale:**
- Sponsors may want to preview tiers before registration
- Pricing transparency builds trust
- No sensitive data exposed (just tier capabilities)

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

### Mobile (Flutter)
- **Horizontal scrollable tier cards** (280px width each)
- **Popular badge** on M and L tiers (business recommendation)
- **Feature highlights** per card (data %, logo count, messaging, links)
- **Expandable comparison table** for detailed feature breakdown
- **Visual indicators:** ✅ for enabled, ❌ for disabled features
- **Price prominence:** Large, bold pricing display

### Web (Angular/React)
- **Side-by-side grid layout** (4 columns)
- **Sticky header** for price comparison during scroll
- **Detailed feature rows** with hover tooltips
- **Interactive selection** with visual feedback
- **Responsive design** (collapses to cards on mobile)
