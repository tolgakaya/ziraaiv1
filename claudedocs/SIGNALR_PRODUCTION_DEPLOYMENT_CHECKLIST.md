## ‚è≥ Phase 3: Production Preparation (PENDING)

### Railway Production Environment Setup

#### 3.1 WebAPI Service Variables
```bash
# Environment
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production

# SignalR Notification System
WebAPI__BaseUrl=https://ziraai-api-prod.up.railway.app
WebAPI__InternalSecret=<GENERATE_SECURE_SECRET>

# Redis (if horizontal scaling)
UseRedis=false  # Set to true if using multiple instances
REDIS_URL=<redis-connection-string>  # Only if UseRedis=true
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Generate secure production secret (32+ characters)
  ```bash
  # PowerShell
  [Convert]::ToBase64String((1..32 | ForEach-Object { Get-Random -Maximum 256 }))
  ```
- [ ] Set `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`
- [ ] Set `WebAPI__BaseUrl` to production URL
- [ ] Set `WebAPI__InternalSecret` to generated secret
- [ ] Document secret in secure location (1Password/Azure Key Vault)

#### 3.2 Worker Service Variables
```bash
# Environment
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production

# SignalR Notification System
WebAPI__BaseUrl=https://ziraai-api-prod.up.railway.app
WebAPI__InternalSecret=<SAME_SECRET_AS_WEBAPI>
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Use SAME secret as WebAPI
- [ ] Verify Worker Service and WebAPI share same secret
- [ ] Set correct production WebAPI URL

#### 3.3 CORS Verification
**File**: `WebAPI/Startup.cs`

Production domains should already be configured:
```csharp
.WithOrigins(
    "https://app.ziraai.com",
    "https://ziraai.com"
)
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Verify production domains in CORS policy
- [ ] Test CORS from production domain
- [ ] Ensure `AllowCredentials()` is present for SignalR

---

## üü° Phase 4: Horizontal Scaling (OPTIONAL)

**Required If**:
- Multiple Railway instances
- Auto-scaling enabled
- Load balancing configured

**Skip If**:
- Single Railway instance
- Low traffic expected initially

### Redis Backplane Setup

#### 4.1 Add NuGet Package
```bash
dotnet add WebAPI package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.StackExchangeRedis
```

#### 4.2 Update Startup.cs
Code already prepared in `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` Section 4.

#### 4.3 Railway Redis Service
- [ ] Add Redis service in Railway project
- [ ] Link Redis to WebAPI service
- [ ] Set `UseRedis=true` environment variable
- [ ] Verify `REDIS_URL` is automatically provided by Railway

#### 4.4 Testing
- [ ] Deploy 2 WebAPI instances
- [ ] Connect client to instance A
- [ ] Trigger notification via instance B
- [ ] Verify client receives notification

---

## üü¢ Phase 5: Production Deployment

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Deployment Steps

#### Step 1: Deploy WebAPI to Production
```bash
# Merge to production branch
git checkout master
git merge staging --no-ff
git push origin master

# Railway auto-deploys from master branch
# Monitor deployment in Railway dashboard
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Deployment successful (no errors)
- [ ] Health check passing: `https://api.ziraai.com/health`
- [ ] SignalR Hub accessible: `wss://api.ziraai.com/hubs/plantanalysis`
- [ ] Logs show correct environment: `Hosting environment: Production`
- [ ] Internal secret loaded: `‚úÖ Internal secret loaded - Length: XX`

#### Step 2: Deploy Worker Service to Production
```bash
# Worker Service should auto-deploy when master branch updates
# Monitor Railway dashboard for Worker deployment
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] Worker connects to RabbitMQ successfully
- [ ] Logs show correct environment: `[WORKER] PlantAnalysisWorkerService starting in Production environment`
- [ ] Internal secret matches: `‚úÖ Internal secret loaded - Length: XX`
- [ ] Worker can reach WebAPI: `‚úÖ WebAPI URL loaded: https://api.ziraai.com`

#### Step 3: Test SignalR Connection
Use test client or Flutter app (when ready):

```html
<!-- Test with claudedocs/test_signalr_client.html -->
<!-- Update URL to: https://api.ziraai.com/hubs/plantanalysis -->
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Connection establishes successfully
- [ ] Ping/pong working
- [ ] JWT authentication successful
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

#### Step 4: End-to-End Production Test
```bash
# Create a real async plant analysis via production API
POST https://api.ziraai.com/api/v1/plantanalyses/analyze-async

# Monitor logs for notification flow:
# 1. Worker processes analysis
# 2. Worker sends HTTP POST to WebAPI
# 3. WebAPI receives notification
# 4. WebAPI broadcasts via SignalR Hub
# 5. Client receives notification
```

**Verification**:
- [ ] Analysis created successfully
- [ ] Worker processes analysis (check logs)
- [ ] Notification sent from Worker ‚Üí WebAPI (200 OK)
- [ ] SignalR Hub receives notification
- [ ] Client receives `ReceiveAnalysisCompleted` event
- [ ] Notification data correct (analysisId, userId, etc.)

## üìä Phase 6: Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First 24 Hours

#### Metrics to Track
- [ ] SignalR connection count (target: stable growth)
- [ ] Notification delivery success rate (target: >95%)
- [ ] Average notification latency (target: <200ms)
- [ ] Internal API success rate (target: >99%)
- [ ] Error rate (target: <1%)

#### Logs to Monitor
```bash
# Railway logs to watch
railway logs --service webapi --tail
railway logs --service worker --tail

# Look for:
‚úÖ SignalR connections
‚úÖ Notification deliveries
‚ùå Authentication failures
‚ùå Connection errors
‚ùå Internal API failures
```

#### Alerts to Set Up
- [ ] Connection failure rate > 10% ‚Üí Critical
- [ ] Notification delivery failure > 5% ‚Üí Critical
- [ ] Internal API failure > 1% ‚Üí Warning
- [ ] Memory usage > 80% ‚Üí Warning
- [ ] CPU usage > 80% ‚Üí Warning

### First Week Review

- [ ] Review connection patterns (peak hours, geographic distribution)
- [ ] Analyze notification delivery latency trends
- [ ] Check for memory leaks or resource exhaustion
- [ ] Review error patterns and fix recurring issues
- [ ] User feedback collection (via support team)
- [ ] Performance optimization opportunities identified

### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Concurrent Connections | 1,000+ | TBD | ‚è≥ |
| Notification Latency | <200ms | TBD | ‚è≥ |
| Delivery Success Rate | >95% | TBD | ‚è≥ |
| Internal API Success | >99% | TBD | ‚è≥ |

## üö® Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions
- Critical failure rate > 10%
- System downtime > 5 minutes
- Data corruption detected
- Severe performance degradation

### Rollback Procedure

#### Option 1: Disable SignalR (Keep System Running)
```csharp
// Emergency: Comment out SignalR registration in Startup.cs
// services.AddSignalR();
// endpoints.MapHub<PlantAnalysisHub>("/hubs/plantanalysis");

// Redeploy WebAPI
// System continues working without real-time notifications
// Users can still poll for results
```

#### Option 2: Railway Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
railway rollback --service webapi
railway rollback --service worker
```

#### Option 3: Emergency Configuration
```bash
# Disable SignalR via environment variable
railway variables set ENABLE_SIGNALR=false --service webapi
```

### Post-Rollback Actions
- [ ] Notify mobile/web teams
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Document incident details
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem meeting
- [ ] Create follow-up tasks for fixes
