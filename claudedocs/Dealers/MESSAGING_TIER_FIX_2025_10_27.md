# Messaging Tier Validation Fix - 2025-10-27

## Problem
Messaging endpoints were incorrectly validating tier permissions based on **user's purchases** instead of **analysis tier**.

### Error Symptoms
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Messaging is only available for L and XL tier sponsors"
}
```

This error appeared even when the analysis had the correct tier (M, L, or XL) because the system was checking the sponsor's OTHER purchases instead of the SPECIFIC analysis being messaged.

## Root Cause

### Incorrect Logic (BEFORE)
```csharp
// ❌ WRONG: Checking user's ALL purchases
public async Task<bool> CanSendMessageAsync(int sponsorId)
{
    var profile = await _sponsorProfileRepository.GetBySponsorIdAsync(sponsorId);
    if (profile.SponsorshipPurchases != null && profile.SponsorshipPurchases.Any())
    {
        foreach (var purchase in profile.SponsorshipPurchases)
        {
            var hasMessaging = await _tierFeatureService.HasFeatureAccessAsync(
                purchase.SubscriptionTierId, "messaging");
            if (hasMessaging) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Problem:** This checks if sponsor has ANY purchase with messaging feature, not if the CURRENT ANALYSIS has messaging.

### Core Architectural Principle
**Users don't have tiers - Analyses have tiers!**

Reference: `claudedocs/TIER_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Solution

### Correct Logic (AFTER)
```csharp
// ✅ CORRECT: Checking ANALYSIS tier
public async Task<bool> CanSendMessageAsync(int userId, int plantAnalysisId)
{
    // 1. Get the analysis
    var analysis = await _plantAnalysisRepository.GetAsync(a => a.Id == plantAnalysisId);
    if (analysis == null || !analysis.ActiveSponsorshipId.HasValue) 
        return false;

    // 2. Get the sponsorship (UserSubscription) for THIS analysis
    var userSubscription = await _userSubscriptionRepository.GetAsync(
        us => us.Id == analysis.ActiveSponsorshipId.Value);
    if (userSubscription == null) 
        return false;

    // 3. Check if THIS analysis's tier has messaging
    var hasMessaging = await _tierFeatureService.HasFeatureAccessAsync(
        userSubscription.SubscriptionTierId, "messaging");
    return hasMessaging;
}
```

**Key Chain:**
```
PlantAnalysis.ActiveSponsorshipId 
  → UserSubscription.Id 
    → UserSubscription.SubscriptionTierId 
      → TierFeature check
```

## Files Changed

### 1. `Business/Services/Sponsorship/AnalysisMessagingService.cs`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `IUserSubscriptionRepository` dependency
- ✅ Changed `CanSendMessageAsync(int sponsorId)` → `CanSendMessageAsync(int userId, int plantAnalysisId)`
- ✅ Updated `CanSendMessageForAnalysisAsync` to use new signature
- ✅ Updated `CanReplyToMessageAsync` to pass `plantAnalysisId`
- ✅ Updated `HasMessagingPermissionAsync` to require `plantAnalysisId`
- ✅ Removed incorrect user-purchase iteration logic
- ✅ Implemented correct analysis → userSubscription → tier chain

### 2. `Business/Services/Sponsorship/IAnalysisMessagingService.cs`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated interface signature: `Task<bool> CanSendMessageAsync(int userId, int plantAnalysisId)`
- ✅ Updated interface signature: `Task<bool> HasMessagingPermissionAsync(int sponsorId, int plantAnalysisId)`

## Verification

### Test Case 1: Analysis with M Tier (Messaging Available)
```bash
# Analysis ID 59 has M tier sponsorship
POST /api/v1/sponsorship/messages
{
  "toUserId": 165,
  "plantAnalysisId": 59,
  "message": "Test message"
}

# Expected: ✅ Success (M tier has messaging feature)
```

### Test Case 2: Analysis with S Tier (Messaging NOT Available)
```bash
# Analysis with S tier sponsorship
POST /api/v1/sponsorship/messages
{
  "toUserId": 165,
  "plantAnalysisId": XX,
  "message": "Test message"
}

# Expected: ❌ "Messaging is not available for this analysis tier. Upgrade to M tier or higher"
```

### Test Case 3: Unsponsored Analysis
```bash
# Analysis without ActiveSponsorshipId
POST /api/v1/sponsorship/messages
{
  "toUserId": 165,
  "plantAnalysisId": XX,
  "message": "Test message"
}

# Expected: ❌ "This analysis is not sponsored"
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Messaging failed even with correct analysis tier
- ❌ System checked wrong tier (user's other purchases)
- ❌ Farmers/Sponsors couldn't message on valid M/L/XL analyses

### After Fix
- ✅ Messaging works correctly based on analysis tier
- ✅ System checks correct tier (analysis's ActiveSponsorshipId)
- ✅ M/L/XL tier analyses enable messaging as expected
- ✅ S tier and unsponsored analyses correctly blocked
