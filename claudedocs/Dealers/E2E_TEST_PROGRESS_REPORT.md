## Critical Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: SecuredOperation Authorization Failure

**Problem:**
Transfer endpoint returned `AuthorizationsDenied` despite:
- Claim existing in database (`TransferCodesToDealerCommand`)
- Claim assigned to Sponsor group (GroupId=3)
- User 159 being in Sponsor group
- Claim cached in Redis

**Root Cause:**
`invocation.Method?.DeclaringType?.Name` was returning **interface name** `"IRequest\`2"` instead of **handler class name** `"TransferCodesToDealerCommandHandler"`.

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Verified claim exists in database ✅
2. Verified claim assigned to Sponsor group ✅
3. Verified User 159 in Sponsor group ✅
4. Added debug logging to SecuredOperation
5. Discovered operation name extraction was incorrect

**Solution:**
Changed from:
```csharp
var operationName = invocation.Method?.DeclaringType?.Name;
```

To:
```csharp
var operationName = invocation.TargetType?.Name;
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Business/BusinessAspects/SecuredOperation.cs` - Fixed operation name extraction
- Added `using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;` for debug logging

**Commits:**
- `10d5289` - Added SecuredOperation logging
- `b87756e` - Fixed missing using directive
- `16a2723` - Fixed TargetType vs DeclaringType issue

---

## Technical Details

### Authorization Flow

1. **Login:** User authenticates via phone OTP
2. **Token Creation:** `PhoneAuthenticationProvider.CreateToken()`
   - Fetches claims via `UserRepository.GetClaimsAsync()`
   - Caches claims in Redis: `CacheKeys.UserIdForClaim={userId}`
3. **Authorization Check:** `SecuredOperation` aspect intercepts handler
   - Extracts userId from JWT token
   - Retrieves claims from Redis cache
   - Extracts operation name from handler class name
   - Removes "Handler" suffix to match claim name
   - Validates claim exists in user's cached claims

### Claim Naming Convention

**Pattern:** `{HandlerClassName}` - `"Handler"` = `{ClaimName}`

**Examples:**
- Handler: `TransferCodesToDealerCommandHandler`
- Claim: `TransferCodesToDealerCommand`

### SQL Migration

**File:** `claudedocs/Dealers/migrations/004_dealer_authorization.sql`

**Claims Created:**
1. TransferCodesToDealerCommand
2. CreateDealerInvitationCommand
3. ReclaimDealerCodesCommand
4. GetDealerPerformanceQuery
5. GetDealerSummaryQuery
6. GetDealerInvitationsQuery
7. SearchDealerByEmailQuery

**Group Assignments:**
- Sponsor Group (GroupId=3): All 7 claims
- Admin Group (GroupId=1): All 7 claims

---

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Claim Assignment
```sql
-- File: claudedocs/Dealers/check_transfer_claim.sql
SELECT
    g."GroupName",
    oc."Name" as "ClaimName",
    oc."Alias" as "ClaimAlias"
FROM public."GroupClaims" gc
INNER JOIN "Groups" g ON gc."GroupId" = g."Id"
INNER JOIN public."OperationClaims" oc ON gc."ClaimId" = oc."Id"
WHERE g."Id" = 3 -- Sponsor group
  AND oc."Name" LIKE '%Transfer%'
ORDER BY oc."Name";
```

**Result:** ✅ TransferCodesToDealerCommand assigned to Sponsor group

### Verify User Claims (Simulating GetClaimsAsync)
```sql
-- File: claudedocs/Dealers/test_getclaims_user159.sql
SELECT DISTINCT oc."Name" as "ClaimName"
FROM public."Users" u
INNER JOIN public."UserGroups" ug ON u."UserId" = ug."UserId"
INNER JOIN public."GroupClaims" gc ON ug."GroupId" = gc."GroupId"
INNER JOIN public."OperationClaims" oc ON gc."ClaimId" = oc."Id"
WHERE u."UserId" = 159
UNION
SELECT oc."Name" as "ClaimName"
FROM public."Users" u
INNER JOIN public."UserClaims" uc ON u."UserId" = uc."UserId"
INNER JOIN public."OperationClaims" oc ON uc."ClaimId" = oc."Id"
WHERE u."UserId" = 159
ORDER BY "ClaimName";
```

**Result:** 24 claims including TransferCodesToDealerCommand ✅

---

## Logs Analysis

### PhoneAuthenticationProvider Log
```
[PhoneAuth:Claims] User 159 has 24 claims: CreateDealerInvitationCommand,
GetCodeAnalysisStatisticsQuery, GetCodeAnalysisStatisticsQueryHandler,
GetDealerInvitationsQuery, GetDealerPerformanceQuery, GetDealerSummaryQuery, ...
```

### SecuredOperation Debug Log (Before Fix)
```
[SecuredOperation] UserId: 159, Operation: IRequest`2, CachedClaims:
CreateDealerInvitationCommand, GetCodeAnalysisStatisticsQuery, ...,
TransferCodesToDealerCommand
```

**Analysis:** Operation name was `IRequest\`2` (interface) instead of `TransferCodesToDealerCommandHandler` (handler class).

### SecuredOperation Debug Log (After Fix)
Expected to show:
```
[SecuredOperation] UserId: 159, Operation: TransferCodesToDealerCommand,
CachedClaims: ..., TransferCodesToDealerCommand
```

## Completed E2E Test Steps (Fresh Farmer Test)

### ✅ Step 3: Transfer Codes from Sponsor to Dealer

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/sponsorship/dealer/transfer-codes`
**Codes Transferred:** 945, 946, 947 (3 codes from Purchase ID 26)
**Dealer:** UserId 158 (User 1113)

### ✅ Step 4: Dealer Distributes Code to Farmer

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/sponsorship/send-link`
**Farmer:** UserId 170 (User 3978) - Fresh farmer for E2E test
**Code Sent:** AGRI-2025-36767AD6 (Code ID 945)
**Result:** Code successfully sent to farmer via link

### ✅ Step 5: Farmer Redeems Code

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/sponsorship/redeem`
**Code:** AGRI-2025-36767AD6
**Result:** Successfully redeemed, farmer's subscription activated

### ✅ Step 6: Farmer Performs Plant Analysis

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/PlantAnalyses/async`
**Processing:** Asynchronous via RabbitMQ (2-5 minute processing time)
**Analysis IDs:** 76, 75
**Attribution:** 
- SponsorCompanyId: 159 (Main sponsor)
- DealerId: 158 (Dealer who distributed code)
- ActiveSponsorshipId: 170 (Farmer's subscription)

### ✅ Step 7: Dealer Views Own Analyses

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/analyses`
**Token-Based Detection:** DealerId auto-detected from JWT token (userId)
**Query Logic:** `WHERE (SponsorUserId = userId OR DealerId = userId)`

**Result:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "analyses": [
      {
        "id": 76,
        "userId": 170,
        "userName": "User 3978",
        "sponsorCompanyId": 159,
        "dealerId": 158,
        "canMessage": true,
        "canViewLogo": true
      },
      {
        "id": 75,
        "userId": 170,
        "userName": "User 3978",
        "sponsorCompanyId": 159,
        "dealerId": 158,
        "canMessage": true,
        "canViewLogo": true
      }
    ],
    "totalCount": 2,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 1
  },
  "success": true
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Dealer sees ONLY 2 analyses from farmer 170 (who used dealer's code)
- ✅ Correct attribution: DealerId = 158
- ✅ Messaging and logo viewing enabled

### ✅ Step 8: Main Sponsor Views All Analyses

**Status:** COMPLETED
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/analyses`
**Query Logic:** Same OR query supports hybrid sponsor/dealer role

**Result:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "analyses": [...],
    "totalCount": 18,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "totalPages": 2
  },
  "success": true
}
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Sponsor sees ALL 18 analyses (including dealer-distributed 2)
- ✅ Hybrid role support: Shows analyses where user is sponsor OR dealer
- ✅ Includes analyses from codes 945-947 distributed through dealer

---

## Critical Issues Encountered and Resolved (E2E Test Phase)

### Issue 2: DealerId Not Captured in Plant Analysis

**Problem:**
After farmer performed analysis using dealer-distributed code, DealerId field was NULL in database despite code having DealerId = 158.

**Root Cause:**
`CaptureActiveSponsorAsync` method captured `SponsorCompanyId` and `ActiveSponsorshipId` but not `DealerId`.

**Investigation:**
```sql
-- Check analysis attribution
SELECT 
    pa."Id" as "AnalysisId",
    pa."UserId",
    pa."SponsorCompanyId",
    pa."DealerId",
    pa."ActiveSponsorshipId"
FROM public."PlantAnalyses" pa
WHERE pa."Id" IN (75, 76);

-- Result: DealerId was NULL
```

**Solution:**
Added DealerId capture in both sync and async analysis handlers:

**File 1:** `Business/Handlers/PlantAnalyses/Commands/CreatePlantAnalysisCommand.cs:454-457`
```csharp
analysis.ActiveSponsorshipId = activeSponsorship.Id;
analysis.SponsorCompanyId = code.SponsorId;
analysis.DealerId = code.DealerId; // NEW: Capture dealer who distributed code
```

**File 2:** `PlantAnalysisWorkerService/Jobs/PlantAnalysisJobService.cs:665-669`
```csharp
analysis.ActiveSponsorshipId = activeSponsorship.Id;
analysis.SponsorCompanyId = code.SponsorId;
analysis.DealerId = code.DealerId; // NEW: Capture dealer who distributed code
```

**Commit:** `e6a5c10` - "feat: Add DealerId attribution to plant analysis"

---

### Issue 3: Hybrid Sponsor/Dealer Role Support

**Problem:**
Initial query implementation only checked `WHERE SponsorUserId = userId`, which didn't support:
1. Pure dealers viewing their distributed analyses (DealerId = userId)
2. Hybrid users who are BOTH sponsor AND dealer

**User Requirement:**
> "Sponsor için analizde sponsorid alanı userid olmalı, Eğer bir dealer hem sponsor hem dealer olarka kod dağıtıyorsa onun analizleri 'sponsorid=userid veya dealerid=userid' şeklinde bir sorgu gerektirir"

**Solution:**
Changed repository query to OR logic in `GetSponsoredAnalysesListQuery.cs:105-120`:

```csharp
// Build query: Get all analyses where user is involved as sponsor OR dealer
// - As Sponsor: SponsorUserId = userId (codes distributed directly by sponsor)
// - As Dealer: DealerId = userId (codes distributed by dealer on behalf of sponsor)
// - Both roles: Show analyses from both capacities
var query = _plantAnalysisRepository.GetListAsync(a =>
    (a.SponsorUserId == request.SponsorId || a.DealerId == request.SponsorId) &&
    a.AnalysisStatus != null
);

var allAnalyses = await query;
var analysesQuery = allAnalyses.AsQueryable();

// Optional: Filter by specific DealerId if provided (for admin/sponsor monitoring specific dealer)
if (request.DealerId.HasValue && request.DealerId.Value != request.SponsorId)
{
    analysesQuery = analysesQuery.Where(a => a.DealerId == request.DealerId.Value);
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Business/Handlers/PlantAnalyses/Queries/GetSponsoredAnalysesListQuery.cs` - OR query logic
- `WebAPI/Controllers/SponsorshipController.cs` - Added optional dealerId parameter

**Commits:**
- `4181003` - "feat: Add dealerId query parameter to sponsorship analyses endpoint"
- `e186e2b` - "fix: Auto-detect dealer role from token for analysis filtering" (interim solution)
- `32f4beb` - "feat: Show analyses for both sponsor and dealer roles with OR query" (final solution)

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Pure dealer (158): Sees 2 analyses where DealerId = 158
- ✅ Pure sponsor (159): Sees 18 analyses where SponsorUserId = 159
- ✅ Hybrid user (if exists): Would see analyses from BOTH roles
- ✅ Token-based detection: No manual role checking needed

## Pending Steps

### ⏳ Step 9: Verify Dealer Analytics
**Status:** PENDING
**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/dealer/performance/{dealerId}`
- `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/dealer/summary`

### ⏳ Step 10: Test Tier-Based Messaging
**Status:** PENDING
**Validation:** Messaging permissions based on subscription tier

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Castle DynamicProxy Behavior**: `invocation.Method.DeclaringType` returns interface type for intercepted methods, not the actual handler class. Use `invocation.TargetType` instead.

2. **Redis Cache Persistence**: Deploy/restart does not clear Redis cache (unlike in-memory cache). Claims cached during login persist across deployments.

3. **Claim Naming Convention**: Claims must match handler class name minus "Handler" suffix. Any deviation breaks authorization.

4. **Debug Logging Essential**: Adding detailed logging to SecuredOperation was critical for identifying the root cause.

5. **SQL Idempotency**: Using `WHERE NOT EXISTS` instead of `ON CONFLICT` for PostgreSQL compatibility when Name field has no UNIQUE constraint.

6. **Attribution Chain Completeness**: All sponsor-related analyses must capture BOTH `SponsorCompanyId` AND `DealerId` to support multi-tier distribution tracking.

7. **Hybrid Role Support**: OR query logic (`SponsorUserId = userId OR DealerId = userId`) elegantly handles users who are both sponsor and dealer without role detection.

8. **Token-Based Role Detection**: Always derive role context from JWT token's userId rather than query parameters, matching existing patterns (e.g., SponsorId extraction).

9. **Asynchronous Processing Verification**: RabbitMQ-based async analysis requires 2-5 minute wait time for completion before verification.

10. **Fresh User Testing**: Using a fresh farmer (170) instead of existing user (165) ensured clean test data without subscription conflicts
