**Started**: 2025-10-26  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Database Setup & Entities (COMPLETED)
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Build Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Created folder structure: `claudedocs/Dealers/migrations/`
2. ✅ SQL Migration Scripts:
   - `001_add_dealerid_columns.sql` - Added DealerId columns to SponsorshipCodes and PlantAnalyses
   - `002_create_dealer_invitations.sql` - Created DealerInvitations table
   - `003_verification_queries.sql` - Backward compatibility verification queries
3. ✅ Entity Updates:
   - `Entities/Concrete/SponsorshipCode.cs` - Added 5 dealer distribution properties
   - `Entities/Concrete/PlantAnalysis.cs` - Added DealerId property
   - `Entities/Concrete/DealerInvitation.cs` - NEW entity with 17 properties
4. ✅ Build Checkpoint #1: PASSED

#### Issues Encountered:
- **Issue #1**: Missing `User` type in DealerInvitation navigation properties
  - **Solution**: Removed navigation properties (following SponsorshipCode pattern)
- **Issue #2**: Syntax error with double closing braces
  - **Solution**: Corrected regex replacement

---

### ✅ Phase 2: DTOs & Commands/Queries (COMPLETED)

   - `Entities/Dtos/DealerInvitationDto.cs` - Create, response, and list DTOs
   - `Entities/Dtos/DealerPerformanceDto.cs` - Performance analytics and summary DTOs
2. ✅ Created Commands:
   - `Business/Handlers/Sponsorship/Commands/TransferCodesToDealerCommand.cs`

   - `Business/Handlers/Sponsorship/Queries/SearchDealerByEmailQuery.cs`
4. ✅ Build Checkpoint #2: PASSED

#### Issues Encountered:
- **Issue #3**: Missing using directives (System, System.Collections.Generic)
  - **Solution**: Added required using statements to all DTO files
- **Issue #4**: User type not found in SearchDealerByEmailQuery
  - **Solution**: Created DealerSearchResultDto instead of using User entity directly

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Repository & DbContext (COMPLETED)
**Duration**: ~1 hour

5. ✅ Build Checkpoint #3: PASSED

#### Issues Encountered:
- **Issue #5**: Wrong base class names (IRepository vs IEntityRepository)
  - **Solution**: Changed to IEntityRepository and EfEntityRepositoryBase
- **Issue #6**: Entity property name mismatch in configuration
  - **Solution**: Updated configuration to match actual entity properties (CreatedDate, ExpiryDate, etc.)

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Business Logic (COMPLETED)
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Build Status**: ✅ PASSED

#### Completed Tasks:
1. ✅ Created Handler Implementations (7 handlers):

2. ✅ Implemented business logic for each handler
3. ✅ Added validation logic for dealer role, code availability
4. ✅ Build Checkpoint #4: PASSED (38 warnings, 0 errors)

#### Issues Encountered:
- **Issue #7**: Wrong User entity properties (Id, FirstName, LastName)
  - **Solution**: Changed to UserId and FullName (parsed into FirstName/LastName for DTOs)
- **Issue #8**: Wrong repository method names (AddAsync, UpdateAsync)
  - **Solution**: Changed to Add/Update + SaveChangesAsync pattern
- **Issue #9**: GetUserGroupsAsync return type (assumed objects with GroupName)
  - **Solution**: Changed to direct string comparison (returns List<string>)
- **Issue #10**: IPlantAnalysisRepository.GetAllAsync doesn't exist
  - **Solution**: Changed to GetListAsync() method
- **Issue #11**: Missing user group assignment in AutoCreate

4. ✅ Main sponsor can view dealer's analyses by passing DealerId parameter
5. ✅ Build Checkpoint #7: PASSED
6. ✅ Backward compatible - existing queries work without DealerId

---

### ✅ Phase 9: API Documentation (COMPLETED)
