# Access Percentage Logic Fix - CRITICAL CORRECTION

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Business Logic Error
**File:** `Business/Handlers/PlantAnalyses/Queries/GetSponsoredAnalysesListQuery.cs`

---

## ‚ùå Previous WRONG Logic

**Misunderstanding**: Access percentage controls which FIELDS are visible per analysis

```csharp
// WRONG APPROACH - Filtered FIELDS per analysis
if (accessPercentage >= 30) {
    dto.OverallHealthScore = analysis.OverallHealthScore;
    dto.PlantSpecies = analysis.PlantSpecies;
    // ... show 30% of fields
}
if (accessPercentage >= 60) {
    dto.VigorScore = analysis.VigorScore;
    dto.HealthSeverity = analysis.HealthSeverity;
    // ... show additional 30% of fields
}
```

**Problem**:
- User with L tier (60%) ‚Üí Saw ALL 18 analyses, but missing 40% of fields
- User with S tier (30%) ‚Üí Saw ALL 18 analyses, but missing 70% of fields
- **Mobile app broke** because critical fields were missing (overallHealthScore, plantSpecies, imageUrl, etc.)

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Logic (FIXED)

**Understanding**: Access percentage controls HOW MANY analyses are visible (not which fields)

```csharp
// ‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH - Limit ANALYSIS COUNT
if (accessPercentage < 100)
{
    var allowedCount = (int)Math.Ceiling(totalCount * (accessPercentage / 100.0));
    filteredAnalyses = filteredAnalyses.Take(allowedCount).ToList();
    totalCount = filteredAnalyses.Count;
}

// All visible analyses show ALL fields (no conditional field filtering)
dto.OverallHealthScore = analysis.OverallHealthScore;
dto.PlantSpecies = analysis.PlantSpecies;
dto.PlantVariety = analysis.PlantVariety;
dto.GrowthStage = analysis.GrowthStage;
dto.ImageUrl = analysis.ImageUrl;
dto.VigorScore = analysis.VigorScore;
dto.HealthSeverity = analysis.HealthSeverity;
dto.PrimaryConcern = analysis.PrimaryConcern;
dto.Location = analysis.Location;
```

**Result**:
- User with XL tier (100%) ‚Üí Sees ALL 18 analyses (18 * 100% = 18)
- User with L tier (60%) ‚Üí Sees 11 analyses (18 * 60% = 10.8 ‚Üí 11)
- User with M tier (30%) ‚Üí Sees 6 analyses (18 * 30% = 5.4 ‚Üí 6)
- User with S tier (30%) ‚Üí Sees 6 analyses (18 * 30% = 5.4 ‚Üí 6)
- User with Trial tier (0%) ‚Üí Sees 0 analyses

**Each visible analysis includes ALL fields with complete data!**

## Business Logic Rules

### Tier Access Levels

| Tier | Access % | Example: 100 Total Analyses | Fields Visible |
|------|----------|------------------------------|----------------|
| Trial | 0% | 0 analyses | N/A (no access) |
| S | 30% | 30 analyses | ALL fields |
| M | 60% | 60 analyses | ALL fields |
| L | 100% | 100 analyses | ALL fields |
| XL | 100% | 100 analyses | ALL fields + Farmer Contact |

### Special Rules

1. **Farmer Contact Info** (XL tier only):
   - `FarmerName`, `FarmerPhone`, `FarmerEmail` only visible to XL tier
   - All other fields visible to ALL tiers (on visible analyses)

2. **Messaging Permission**:
   - `canMessage = true` for M, L, XL tiers (‚â•30% access)
   - `canMessage = false` for Trial, S tiers (<30% access)

3. **Logo Visibility**:
   - `canViewLogo = true` for ALL tiers

## Files Changed

### `GetSponsoredAnalysesListQuery.cs` (Lines 203-213)

**Added**: Analysis count limiting based on access percentage

```csharp
// üéØ NEW: Apply access percentage limit to analysis COUNT (not fields!)
// - 100% tier ‚Üí Show all analyses (no limit)
// - 60% tier ‚Üí Show 60% of analyses (each with full data)
// - 30% tier ‚Üí Show 30% of analyses (each with full data)
// - 0% tier ‚Üí Show 0 analyses
if (accessPercentage < 100)
{
    var allowedCount = (int)Math.Ceiling(totalCount * (accessPercentage / 100.0));
    filteredAnalyses = filteredAnalyses.Take(allowedCount).ToList();
    totalCount = filteredAnalyses.Count; // Update total count after limiting
}
```

### `MapToSummaryDto` Method (Lines 321-377)

**Removed**: All conditional field assignment based on access percentage

**Before** (WRONG):
```csharp
if (accessPercentage >= 30) {
    dto.OverallHealthScore = analysis.OverallHealthScore;
    // ...
}
if (accessPercentage >= 60) {
    dto.VigorScore = analysis.VigorScore;
    // ...
}
```

**After** (CORRECT):
```csharp
// üéØ ALL analysis fields (no conditional field filtering!)
dto.OverallHealthScore = analysis.OverallHealthScore;
dto.PlantSpecies = analysis.PlantSpecies;
dto.PlantVariety = analysis.PlantVariety;
dto.GrowthStage = analysis.GrowthStage;
dto.ImageUrl = analysis.ImageUrl;
dto.VigorScore = analysis.VigorScore;
dto.HealthSeverity = analysis.HealthSeverity;
dto.PrimaryConcern = analysis.PrimaryConcern;
dto.Location = analysis.Location;
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: L Tier Sponsor (100% Access)
**Setup**: User 159 has L tier purchase (100% after database fix)

**Before Fix**:
```json
{
  "totalCount": 18,
  "items": [
    {
      "analysisId": 76,
      "tierName": "Unknown",  // ‚ùå Wrong
      "accessPercentage": 0,  // ‚ùå Wrong
      "overallHealthScore": null,  // ‚ùå Missing
      "plantSpecies": null,  // ‚ùå Missing
      "imageUrl": null  // ‚ùå Missing
    }
  ]
}
```

**After Fix**:
```json
{
  "totalCount": 18,
  "items": [
    {
      "analysisId": 76,
      "tierName": "L",  // ‚úÖ Correct
      "accessPercentage": 100,  // ‚úÖ Correct (after DB fix)
      "overallHealthScore": 6,  // ‚úÖ Present
      "plantSpecies": "Domates",  // ‚úÖ Present
      "imageUrl": "https://iili.io/K4azIa9.jpg",  // ‚úÖ Present
      "vigorScore": 6,  // ‚úÖ Present
      "primaryConcern": "..."  // ‚úÖ Present
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scenario 2: M Tier Sponsor (60% Access)
**Setup**: Sponsor has M tier (60%)

**Expected Result**: Shows 60% of analyses (e.g., 11 out of 18), each with ALL fields

### Scenario 3: Trial Tier (0% Access)
**Setup**: Sponsor has Trial tier (0%)

**Expected Result**: Shows 0 analyses (empty list)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened

1. **Ambiguous Requirements**: "Access percentage" was interpreted as field-level access control
2. **No Test Coverage**: No integration tests for tier-based access logic
3. **Missing Documentation**: Business rules for access percentage were not documented
4. **Database Migration Not Run**: Tier percentages were wrong in staging database

### Prevention Measures

1. ‚úÖ **Document Business Rules**: This file now serves as canonical reference
2. ‚è≥ **Add Integration Tests**: Test each tier's access behavior
3. ‚è≥ **API Contract Testing**: Verify response structure doesn't change unexpectedly
4. ‚è≥ **Database Migration Checklist**: Ensure all migrations run on staging before deployment

- [ ] Verify mobile app displays all fields correctly
- [ ] Check database tier percentages are correct (S=30%, M=60%, L=100%, XL=100%, Trial=0%)
