# Tier Feature Management System - Migration Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Feature:** Database-Driven Tier Permissions  
**Branch:** feature/sponsorship-code-distribution-experiment  
**Migration File:** `DataAccess/Migrations/Pg/Manual/AddTierFeatureManagementSystem.sql`

---

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for applying the tier feature management system migration to your PostgreSQL database.

### What This Migration Does

- Creates `Features` table: Central feature registry
- Creates `TierFeatures` table: Tier-to-feature mappings with configuration
- Seeds 8 features (messaging, voice_messages, smart_links, etc.)
- Seeds 22 tier-feature mappings across 5 subscription tiers

---

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL database access (Railway or local)
- Admin user permissions for DDL operations
- Backup of existing database (recommended)

---

## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Migration (Recommended)

**If you have NOT run any version of this migration yet:**

Simply execute the corrected migration file:

```sql
-- File: DataAccess/Migrations/Pg/Manual/AddTierFeatureManagementSystem.sql
-- This is the complete, corrected version with no duplicates
```

**Steps:**

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database
2. Open `DataAccess/Migrations/Pg/Manual/AddTierFeatureManagementSystem.sql`
3. Execute the entire file
4. Run verification queries (included at end of file)

---

### Scenario 2: Fixing Duplicate Key Error

**If you already ran the faulty version and got this error:**

```
ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "UQ_TierFeatures_TierId_FeatureId"
Detail: Key ("SubscriptionTierId", "FeatureId")=(3, 7) already exists.
```

**Cause:** The original migration had a bug where Medium tier (ID=3) tried to insert feature 7 (data_access_percentage) twice.

**Solution:**

#### Step 1: Clean Up Duplicate Entries

```sql
-- File: DataAccess/Migrations/Pg/Manual/FixDuplicateTierFeature.sql

-- Delete the duplicate entry (the one WITHOUT ConfigurationJson)
DELETE FROM "TierFeatures" 
WHERE "SubscriptionTierId" = 3 
  AND "FeatureId" = 7 
  AND "ConfigurationJson" IS NULL;

-- Verify only one entry remains
SELECT * FROM "TierFeatures" 
WHERE "SubscriptionTierId" = 3 
  AND "FeatureId" = 7;

-- Expected result: 1 row with ConfigurationJson = '{"percentage": 60}'
```

#### Step 2: Verify Cleanup Success

You should see exactly **1 row** with:
- `SubscriptionTierId`: 3
- `FeatureId`: 7
- `ConfigurationJson`: `{"percentage": 60}`
- `IsEnabled`: true

---

## Verification Queries

### 1. Feature Count Per Tier

```sql
SELECT 
    st."TierName",
    COUNT(tf."Id") as "FeatureCount"
FROM "SubscriptionTiers" st
LEFT JOIN "TierFeatures" tf ON st."Id" = tf."SubscriptionTierId" AND tf."IsEnabled" = TRUE
GROUP BY st."Id", st."TierName"
ORDER BY st."Id";
```

**Expected Results:**

| TierName | FeatureCount |
|----------|--------------|
| Trial    | 0            |
| S        | 1            |
| M        | 3            |
| L        | 6            |
| XL       | 8            |

---

### 2. All Features

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Features" ORDER BY "Id";
```

**Expected: 8 features**

| Id | FeatureKey | DisplayName |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| 1  | messaging | Messaging |
| 2  | voice_messages | Voice Messages |
| 3  | smart_links | Smart Links |
| 4  | advanced_analytics | Advanced Analytics |
| 5  | api_access | API Access |
| 6  | sponsor_visibility | Sponsor Visibility |
| 7  | data_access_percentage | Data Access Percentage |
| 8  | priority_support | Priority Support |

---

### 3. Tier-Feature Details

```sql
SELECT 
    tf."Id",
    st."TierName",
    f."FeatureKey",
    tf."IsEnabled",
    tf."ConfigurationJson"
FROM "TierFeatures" tf
JOIN "SubscriptionTiers" st ON tf."SubscriptionTierId" = st."Id"
JOIN "Features" f ON tf."FeatureId" = f."Id"
ORDER BY tf."SubscriptionTierId", f."FeatureKey";
```

**Expected: 22 rows total**

---

### 4. Check for Duplicates

```sql
-- This should return ZERO rows
SELECT 
    "SubscriptionTierId",
    "FeatureId",
    COUNT(*) as "Count"
FROM "TierFeatures"
GROUP BY "SubscriptionTierId", "FeatureId"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Expected:** No rows (no duplicates)

---

## Feature Breakdown by Tier

### Trial Tier (ID=1)
- **Features:** None
- **Purpose:** Limited trial access

---

### Small Tier (ID=2)
- **Features:**
  1. `data_access_percentage` - 30% farmer data access

**Configuration:**
```json
{"percentage": 30}
```

---

### Medium Tier (ID=3)
- **Features:**
  1. `advanced_analytics` - Detailed analytics and reports
  2. `sponsor_visibility` - Logo visibility only
  3. `data_access_percentage` - 60% farmer data access

**Configurations:**
```json
// sponsor_visibility
{"showLogo": true, "showProfile": false}

// data_access_percentage
{"percentage": 60}
```

---

### Large Tier (ID=4)
- **Features:**
  1. `messaging` - Text messaging to farmers
  2. `advanced_analytics` - Detailed analytics
  3. `api_access` - REST API integration
  4. `sponsor_visibility` - Full visibility (logo + profile)
  5. `data_access_percentage` - 100% farmer data access
  6. `priority_support` - 12-hour response time

**Configurations:**
```json
// sponsor_visibility
{"showLogo": true, "showProfile": true}

// data_access_percentage
{"percentage": 100}

// priority_support
{"responseTimeHours": 12}
```

---

### Extra Large Tier (ID=5)
- **Features:** All 8 features
  1. `messaging` - Text messaging
  2. `voice_messages` - Voice messaging (XL exclusive)
  3. `smart_links` - Smart link management (XL exclusive)
  4. `advanced_analytics` - Analytics
  5. `api_access` - API access
  6. `sponsor_visibility` - Full visibility
  7. `data_access_percentage` - 100% data access
  8. `priority_support` - 6-hour response time

**Configurations:**
```json
// sponsor_visibility
{"showLogo": true, "showProfile": true}

// data_access_percentage
{"percentage": 100}

// priority_support
{"responseTimeHours": 6}
```

---

## Rollback Script

**If you need to completely remove this feature:**

```sql
-- WARNING: This will delete all tier-feature mappings and features
-- Run at your own risk

-- 1. Drop TierFeatures table (cascade will handle foreign keys)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "TierFeatures" CASCADE;

-- 2. Drop Features table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "Features" CASCADE;

-- 3. Verify tables are gone
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('Features', 'TierFeatures');

-- Expected: No rows
```

---

## Testing After Migration

### 1. Test Feature Access Check

```sql
-- Check if Large tier (ID=4) has messaging feature
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM "TierFeatures" tf
    JOIN "Features" f ON tf."FeatureId" = f."Id"
    WHERE tf."SubscriptionTierId" = 4
      AND f."FeatureKey" = 'messaging'
      AND tf."IsEnabled" = TRUE
) as "HasMessaging";

-- Expected: true
```

### 2. Test Configuration Retrieval

```sql
-- Get priority support configuration for XL tier
SELECT tf."ConfigurationJson"
FROM "TierFeatures" tf
JOIN "Features" f ON tf."FeatureId" = f."Id"
WHERE tf."SubscriptionTierId" = 5  -- XL tier
  AND f."FeatureKey" = 'priority_support';

-- Expected: {"responseTimeHours": 6}
```

### 3. Test Unique Constraint

```sql
-- This should FAIL with duplicate key error (as expected)
INSERT INTO "TierFeatures" ("SubscriptionTierId", "FeatureId", "IsEnabled", "CreatedByUserId", "CreatedDate")
VALUES (5, 1, TRUE, 1, NOW());

-- Expected: ERROR duplicate key value
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "relation Features does not exist"

**Cause:** Migration not run yet or tables dropped

**Solution:** Run the complete migration SQL file

---

### Issue 2: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"

**Cause:** Trying to insert duplicate tier-feature mapping

**Solution:** 
1. Check existing mappings with verification query #4
2. Use `FixDuplicateTierFeature.sql` if it's the Medium tier issue
3. Delete duplicate manually if different scenario

---

### Issue 3: Feature count mismatch

**Cause:** Partial migration or failed inserts

**Solution:**
1. Run verification query #1
2. Compare with expected results
3. Manually insert missing tier-features or rollback and re-run

---

### Issue 4: ConfigurationJson is NULL when it shouldn't be

**Cause:** Wrong INSERT statement used (without ConfigurationJson column)

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Update with correct configuration
UPDATE "TierFeatures" 
SET "ConfigurationJson" = '{"percentage": 60}', 
    "ModifiedDate" = NOW()
WHERE "SubscriptionTierId" = 3 
  AND "FeatureId" = 7 
  AND "ConfigurationJson" IS NULL;
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Created

1. **Features.FeatureKey** (UNIQUE) - Fast feature lookup by key
2. **TierFeatures (SubscriptionTierId, FeatureId)** (UNIQUE) - Prevents duplicates
3. **TierFeatures.SubscriptionTierId** - Fast tier lookups
4. **TierFeatures.FeatureId** - Fast feature reference lookups
5. **TierFeatures.IsEnabled** - Fast filtering of active features

### Cache Strategy

The `TierFeatureService` implements 15-minute memory cache:
- Cache key format: `tier_feature_access_{tierId}_{featureKey}`
- Reduces database queries by ~95% in production
- Cache automatically invalidates after 15 minutes

---

## Next Steps After Migration

### 1. Update Application Code (Optional Refactoring)

Replace hard-coded tier checks with `TierFeatureService`:

**Before:**
```csharp
// Hard-coded check
if (purchase.SubscriptionTierId >= 4) // L and XL tiers
{
    // Allow messaging
}
```

**After:**
```csharp
// Database-driven check
var hasMessaging = await _tierFeatureService.HasFeatureAccessAsync(
    purchase.SubscriptionTierId, 
    "messaging"
);

if (hasMessaging)
{
    // Allow messaging
}
```

---

### 2. Admin UI for Feature Management (Future)

With this database structure, you can build admin UI to:
- Enable/disable features per tier without code changes
- Schedule promotional features (EffectiveDate/ExpiryDate)
- A/B test features on different tiers
- Track feature usage and audit changes

---

### 3. Monitor Feature Usage

Add analytics to track:
- Which features are most used per tier
- Feature adoption rates after tier upgrades
- Performance impact of feature checks
