# Session Summary: Mobile API Integration Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Branch**: `feature/sponsor-farmer-chat-enhancements`
**Status**: ✅ Completed

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Missing Response Fields

Updated the following handlers to include ALL missing fields that mobile team reported:

#### AnalysisMessageDto.cs
- ✅ Added attachment fields (HasAttachments, AttachmentCount, AttachmentUrls[], AttachmentTypes[], AttachmentSizes[], AttachmentNames[])
- ✅ Added voice message fields (IsVoiceMessage, VoiceMessageUrl, VoiceMessageDuration, VoiceMessageWaveform)
- ✅ Added edit/delete/forward fields (IsEdited, EditedDate, IsForwarded, ForwardedFromMessageId, IsActive)

#### GetConversationQuery.cs
- ✅ Mapped all attachment metadata fields with JSON deserialization
- ✅ Mapped all voice message fields
- ✅ Mapped all edit/delete/forward status fields
- ✅ Fixed nullable operator errors (AttachmentCount, IsEdited, IsForwarded are non-nullable)

#### SendMessageCommand.cs
- ✅ Added IUserRepository injection for avatar URLs
- ✅ Added sender avatar retrieval (SenderAvatarUrl, SenderAvatarThumbnailUrl)
- ✅ Enhanced response DTO with all attachment fields
- ✅ Added voice message field mapping
- ✅ Added edit/delete/forward status fields
- ✅ Fixed nullable operator errors

#### MarkMessageAsReadCommand.cs
- ✅ Added SignalR IHubContext injection
- ✅ Implemented "MessageRead" real-time event notification
- ✅ Event sends to sender: MessageId, ReadByUserId, ReadAt

### 2. Build Errors Fixed

**Error Type**: CS0019 - Nullable coalescing operator on non-nullable types

**Files Fixed**:
- GetConversationQuery.cs (4 errors)
- SendMessageCommand.cs (3 errors)

**Solution**: Removed `??` operators for non-nullable fields (AttachmentCount, IsEdited, IsForwarded, IsDeleted)

**Build Status**: ✅ Success (0 errors, 30 pre-existing warnings)

### 3. Documentation Created

**File**: `claudedocs/MOBILE_BACKEND_API_INTEGRATION.md` (46KB)

**Contents**:
- 13 messaging endpoints with complete request/response examples
- Avatar management (upload/get/delete)
- Feature flags endpoint
- SignalR real-time events (UserTyping, NewMessage, MessageRead)
- Complete Dart/Flutter data models
- Error handling guide
- Testing guide (Postman + Flutter)
- UI usage examples for all features
