# SMS Referral Auto-Fill & Sponsorship Queue System - Session Özeti

**Session Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Branch:** feature/sms-referral-auto-fill  
**Status:** ✅ Backend Implementation Complete, Migration Ready

---

## 🎯 Tamamlanan İşler

### 1. Environment-Based Redemption URL Configuration
**Problem:** `SendSponsorshipLinkCommand.cs` içinde hardcoded `https://ziraai.com/redeem/` URL'i vardı.

**Çözüm:**
- `SendSponsorshipLinkCommand.cs:98` düzeltildi
- `WebAPI:BaseUrl` configuration kullanılıyor (referral system pattern)
- Development: `localhost:5001/redeem/`
- Staging: `ziraai-api-sit.up.railway.app/redeem/`
- Production: `ziraai.com/redeem/`

**Dosya:** `Business/Handlers/Sponsorship/Commands/SendSponsorshipLinkCommand.cs`

### 2. Sponsorship Queue System (NO Multiple Active Sponsorships)

**Business Rules:**
1. Trial → Sponsor (S/M/L/XL): Immediate activation ✅
2. Active Sponsor → New Sponsor: Queue it (activate when current expires) ✅
3. Each sponsorship from different sponsors: Supported ✅
4. Track which sponsor per analysis: Critical for logo, access, messaging ✅

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Event-driven** queue activation (NOT scheduled job)
- Activates during subscription validation
- No Hangfire dependency
- Integrated into `SubscriptionValidationService.ProcessExpiredSubscriptionsAsync()`

---

## 📊 Database Changes

### New Entities/Enums
- `Entities/Concrete/SubscriptionQueueStatus.cs` (NEW)
  - Pending = 0
  - Active = 1
  - Expired = 2
  - Cancelled = 3

### UserSubscription (4 new fields)
```csharp
public SubscriptionQueueStatus QueueStatus { get; set; } = SubscriptionQueueStatus.Active;
public DateTime? QueuedDate { get; set; }
public DateTime? ActivatedDate { get; set; }
public int? PreviousSponsorshipId { get; set; }
public virtual UserSubscription PreviousSponsorship { get; set; }
```

### PlantAnalysis (2 new fields)
```csharp
public int? ActiveSponsorshipId { get; set; }    // FK to active subscription
public int? SponsorCompanyId { get; set; }       // Denormalized for performance
public virtual UserSubscription ActiveSponsorship { get; set; }
```

**Migration:**
- Entity Framework migration: `AddSponsorshipQueueSystem`
- SQL Script ready: `claudedocs/AddSponsorshipQueueSystem.sql`

---

## 🔧 Modified Files

### Business Logic
1. **`Business/Services/Sponsorship/SponsorshipService.cs`**
   - Added `QueueSponsorship()` - queues sponsorship when user has active one
   - Added `ActivateSponsorship()` - immediate activation for Trial users
   - Updated `RedeemSponsorshipCodeAsync()` - checks queue status

2. **`Business/Services/Subscription/SubscriptionValidationService.cs`**
   - Updated `ProcessExpiredSubscriptionsAsync()` - expires old + activates queued
   - Added `ActivateQueuedSponsorshipsAsync()` - event-driven queue activation

3. **`Business/Handlers/PlantAnalyses/Commands/CreatePlantAnalysisCommand.cs`**
   - Injected `IUserSubscriptionRepository`, `ISponsorshipCodeRepository`
   - Added `CaptureActiveSponsorAsync()` - captures sponsor during analysis creation
   - Sets `ActiveSponsorshipId` and `SponsorCompanyId` on PlantAnalysis

4. **`Business/Handlers/Sponsorship/Commands/SendSponsorshipLinkCommand.cs`**
   - Fixed hardcoded redemption URL
   - Uses `WebAPI:BaseUrl` configuration

### Entities
1. **`Entities/Concrete/SubscriptionQueueStatus.cs`** (NEW)
2. **`Entities/Concrete/UserSubscription.cs`** (MODIFIED)
3. **`Entities/Concrete/PlantAnalysis.cs`** (MODIFIED)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Not Done Yet)

### 1. Database Migration
**Status:** SQL Script ready, NOT applied yet

**Development:**
```bash
psql -U postgres -d ziraai_dev -f "claudedocs/AddSponsorshipQueueSystem.sql"
```

**Staging:**
```bash
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -f claudedocs/AddSponsorshipQueueSystem.sql
```

### 2. Testing Required
- [ ] Trial → Sponsor: Immediate activation
- [ ] Active Sponsor → New Sponsor: Queue behavior
- [ ] Auto-activation when subscription expires
- [ ] PlantAnalysis sponsor attribution (logo display)
- [ ] API endpoint testing with Postman

### 3. Mobile Team Handoff
- [ ] Update mobile app to handle `queueStatus` field
- [ ] Show queue status in UI ("Sırada bekliyor", "Aktif")
- [ ] Display estimated activation date
- [ ] SMS auto-fill for referral codes (separate feature)

## 🔑 Key Implementation Details

### Queue Logic Flow
1. User redeems sponsorship code
2. Check if user has active sponsored subscription
3. **If YES:** Queue it (`QueueStatus = Pending`, store `PreviousSponsorshipId`)
4. **If NO (Trial/None):** Activate immediately (`QueueStatus = Active`)
5. When subscription expires → `ProcessExpiredSubscriptionsAsync()` auto-activates queue

### Event-Driven Activation
- Triggered during subscription validation (every PlantAnalysis request)
- No scheduled job needed
- Immediate activation when previous expires
- Lower overhead, simpler architecture

### Sponsor Attribution
- Every `PlantAnalysis` captures active sponsor at creation time
- `ActiveSponsorshipId` → exact subscription used
- `SponsorCompanyId` → denormalized for fast queries
- **Immutable:** Never changes after analysis creation
- **Purpose:** Logo display, access control, messaging permissions

## 🗂️ Important Paths

**Configuration:**
- Development: `WebAPI/appsettings.Development.json`
- Staging: `WebAPI/appsettings.Staging.json`
- Railway env vars: `WebAPI__BaseUrl`, `Referral__DeepLinkBaseUrl`

**Business Logic:**
- Redemption: `Business/Services/Sponsorship/SponsorshipService.cs`
- Queue Activation: `Business/Services/Subscription/SubscriptionValidationService.cs`
- Analysis Creation: `Business/Handlers/PlantAnalyses/Commands/CreatePlantAnalysisCommand.cs`

**Database:**
- Migration SQL: `claudedocs/AddSponsorshipQueueSystem.sql`
- Guide: `claudedocs/SQL_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Event-Driven (Not Scheduled Job)?
- **Immediate activation** (no 1-hour delay)
- **No Hangfire** infrastructure needed
- **Natural flow** during subscription checks
- **Lower overhead**
- Can add scheduled job later to PlantAnalysisWorkerService if needed

### Why Denormalize SponsorCompanyId in PlantAnalysis?
- **Fast logo queries** without joins
- **Immutable sponsor attribution**
- **Performance optimization** for sponsor filtering
- Trade-off: Small data duplication for big performance gain

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Migration not applied yet** - SQL script ready but needs manual execution
2. **No rollback from code** - only database changes, code is backward compatible
3. **Existing data safe** - migration sets defaults for existing records
4. **Index creation** may take time on large tables (>100K records)
5. **Backup recommended** before production migration
