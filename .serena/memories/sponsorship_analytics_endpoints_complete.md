# Sponsorship Analytics Endpoints Implementation - Session Complete

## Date: 2025-10-10

## Summary
Successfully implemented two comprehensive analytics endpoints for sponsor statistics tracking:
1. Package Distribution Statistics
2. Code-Level Analysis Statistics with drill-down capability

## Implementation Details

### 1. Package Distribution Statistics Endpoint
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/package-statistics`
**Purpose:** Track purchased → distributed → redeemed funnel

**Files Created:**
- `Entities/Dtos/PackageDistributionStatisticsDto.cs`
  - Main DTO with overall metrics
  - PackageBreakdown (per-purchase)
  - TierBreakdown (per-tier aggregation)
  - ChannelBreakdown (SMS/WhatsApp performance)
  
- `Business/Handlers/Sponsorship/Queries/GetPackageDistributionStatisticsQuery.cs`
  - Query handler with funnel calculations
  - Distribution rate, redemption rate, overall success rate
  - Multi-dimensional breakdowns

**Key Metrics:**
- TotalCodesPurchased, TotalCodesDistributed, TotalCodesRedeemed
- DistributionRate = (distributed / purchased) * 100
- RedemptionRate = (redeemed / distributed) * 100
- OverallSuccessRate = (redeemed / purchased) * 100

### 2. Code Analysis Statistics Endpoint
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/code-analysis-statistics`
**Purpose:** Track which codes generated how many plant analyses with drill-down

**Files Created:**
- `Entities/Dtos/CodeAnalysisStatisticsDto.cs`
  - CodeAnalysisBreakdown (per-code metrics)
  - SponsoredAnalysisSummary (individual analysis details with clickable URLs)
  - CropTypeStatistic, DiseaseStatistic (insights)
  
- `Business/Handlers/Sponsorship/Queries/GetCodeAnalysisStatisticsQuery.cs`
  - Code-to-farmer-to-analysis mapping
  - Tier-based privacy filtering (S=30%, M=60%, L/XL=100%)
  - Analysis drill-down with URLs
  - Crop/disease distribution analytics

**Query Parameters:**
- `includeAnalysisDetails` (bool, default: true) - Include full analysis list
- `topCodesCount` (int, default: 10) - Number of top performing codes

**Privacy Rules:**
- L/XL Tier: Full farmer details (name, email, phone, exact location)
- M Tier: "Anonymous", city only, no contact info
- S Tier: "Anonymous", "Limited" location, minimal data

**Key Features:**
- Clickable analysis URLs: `{baseUrl}/api/v1/sponsorship/analysis/{id}`
- Last analysis date and days since last activity
- Top performing codes ranking
- Geographic and crop distribution insights

### 3. Controller Updates
**File:** `WebAPI/Controllers/SponsorshipController.cs`

Added two endpoints:
1. `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/package-statistics`
2. `GET /api/v1/sponsorship/code-analysis-statistics`

Both require `Sponsor` or `Admin` role authorization.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Class Name Conflict
**Error:** `AnalysisSummary` class already exists in `PlantAnalysisAsyncResponseDto.cs`
**Solution:** Renamed to `SponsoredAnalysisSummary` in both DTO and query handler

### Challenge 2: Incorrect PlantAnalysis Field Names
**Error:** Used non-existent fields like `RecordDate`, `City`, `District`, `Status`, `Disease`
**Solution:** 
- Used `find_symbol` to verify actual PlantAnalysis entity structure
- Corrected to: `AnalysisDate`, `Location`, `AnalysisStatus`, `PrimaryIssue`, `PrimaryConcern`, `HealthSeverity`
- Added `ActiveSponsorshipId` check for sponsor logo display

## Build Status
✅ Build succeeded - all errors resolved

## Git Commit
**Branch:** `feature/sponsorship-improvements`
**Commit Message:** "feat: Add comprehensive sponsorship analytics endpoints"
**Files Changed:** 6 files, 2,531+ lines added

## Next Steps Recommendations
1. Test endpoints with real data
2. Add pagination for large code lists
3. Consider caching for expensive analytics queries
4. Add export functionality (CSV/Excel) for reports
5. Implement real-time updates for active code tracking

## API Usage Examples

### Package Statistics
```bash
curl -X GET "https://ziraai.com/api/v1/sponsorship/package-statistics" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

### Code Analysis with Details
```bash
curl -X GET "https://ziraai.com/api/v1/sponsorship/code-analysis-statistics?includeAnalysisDetails=true&topCodesCount=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```
