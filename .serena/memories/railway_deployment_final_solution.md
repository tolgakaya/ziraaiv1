## Railway Dashboard Configuration

### PlantAnalysisWorkerService
**Service Settings:**
- **Root Directory**: `/PlantAnalysisWorkerService`
- **Branch**: `staging` (for staging environment)
- Railway automatically finds `/PlantAnalysisWorkerService/railway.json`

**railway.json content:**
```json
{
  "dockerfilePath": "../Dockerfile.worker",
  "buildCommand": "echo 'Building PlantAnalysisWorkerService - Worker Service'"
}
```

### WebAPI Service
**Service Settings:**
- **Root Directory**: `/WebAPI`
- **Branch**: `staging` (for staging environment)
- Railway automatically finds `/WebAPI/railway.json`

**railway.json content:**
```json
{
  "dockerfilePath": "../Dockerfile.webapi",
  "buildCommand": "echo 'Building ZiraAI WebAPI - REST API Service'"
}
```

## Key Solution Points
1. **Dockerfiles at Repository Root**: `Dockerfile.worker` and `Dockerfile.webapi` at root level
2. **Service-Specific railway.json**: Each service has its own railway.json in its directory
3. **Relative Dockerfile Paths**: Using `../` to reference root-level Dockerfiles from service directories
4. **Build Context**: Repository root, allowing access to all shared dependencies

## Environment Variables (Already Configured)
- Both services have staging and production environment variables set
- Database, Redis, RabbitMQ connection strings configured
- Service-specific settings (UseHangfire, UseTaskScheduler) properly differentiated

## Testing Checklist for Tomorrow
- [ ] Verify PlantAnalysisWorkerService deploys with Dockerfile.worker
- [ ] Verify WebAPI deploys with Dockerfile.webapi
- [ ] Check health endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Validate environment variables are applied
- [ ] Test inter-service communication (RabbitMQ)
- [ ] Monitor resource usage and logs

## Known Issues Resolved
