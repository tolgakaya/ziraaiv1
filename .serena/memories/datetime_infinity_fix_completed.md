# DateTime Infinity Issue Fix - Completed

## Problem
After seed data implementation, login was failing with error:
"Cannot read infinity value since DisableDateTimeInfinityConversions is true"

## Root Cause
The User entity has required DateTime fields (BirthDate) and Gender field that were not being set in:
1. UserSeeds.cs - Seed data creation
2. User entity constructor - Default values

When these fields are not set, they default to DateTime.MinValue (0001-01-01), which PostgreSQL interprets as infinity.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed UserSeeds.cs
Added proper values for all seed users:
- BirthDate: Set valid dates (1980-01-01, 1985-05-15, 1978-10-20)
- Gender: Set values (1 for Male, 2 for Female)
- UpdateContactDate: Set to DateTime.Now

### 2. Fixed User Entity Constructor
Added default value handling in Core/Entities/Concrete/User.cs:
```csharp
if (BirthDate == default(DateTime))
{
    BirthDate = new DateTime(1900, 1, 1);
}
if (Gender == 0)
{
    Gender = 1;
}
```

### 3. Database Fix Script
Created fix_datetime_infinity.sql to update existing records with infinity values.

## Files Modified
- Business/Seeds/UserSeeds.cs
- Core/Entities/Concrete/User.cs
- Created: fix_datetime_infinity.sql

## Testing Required
1. Run the SQL script against local and production databases
2. Test login with existing users
3. Test new user registration
