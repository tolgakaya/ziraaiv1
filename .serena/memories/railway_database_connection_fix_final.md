# Railway Database Connection Fix - Final Solution

## Problem
Railway staging environment was still trying to connect to localhost (127.0.0.1:5432) despite having DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING and ConnectionStrings__DArchPgContext environment variables set correctly.

## Root Cause
The ConfigureRailwayEnvironment() method was being called in Startup constructor, AFTER the configuration was already built. This meant that even though we were setting the ConnectionStrings__DArchPgContext environment variable, it wasn't being picked up by the configuration system.

## Solution Implemented (2025-09-09)

### 1. Moved Environment Variable Configuration to Program.cs
- Added ConfigureRailwayEnvironmentVariables() static method to Program.cs
- Called this method in ConfigureAppConfiguration phase, BEFORE configuration is built
- This ensures environment variables are set and available when configuration is loaded

### 2. Key Changes Made:

#### Program.cs:
```csharp
private static void ConfigureRailwayEnvironmentVariables()
{
    // Check and set ConnectionStrings__DArchPgContext from DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
    var databaseConnectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING");
    var connectionStringFromConfig = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ConnectionStrings__DArchPgContext");
    
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(databaseConnectionString) && string.IsNullOrEmpty(connectionStringFromConfig))
    {
        Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("ConnectionStrings__DArchPgContext", databaseConnectionString);
        Console.WriteLine($"[RAILWAY] Set ConnectionStrings__DArchPgContext from DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING");
    }
}

// Called in CreateHostBuilder:
.ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
{
    ConfigureRailwayEnvironmentVariables(); // BEFORE config is built
    config.AddEnvironmentVariables();
    // ... rest of configuration
})
```

#### Startup.cs:
- Removed ConfigureRailwayEnvironment() method completely
- Constructor now only calls base constructor

### 3. Debug Logging Added:
- Added logging to verify connection string is being set correctly
- Logs truncated connection string for security

## Environment Variables Required on Railway:
- `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` or `ConnectionStrings__DArchPgContext`
- Both should contain the full PostgreSQL connection string
- Format: `Host=tramway.proxy.rlwy.net;Port=39540;Database=railway;Username=postgres;Password=...`

## Verification Steps:
1. Check deployment logs for "[RAILWAY]" messages
2. Verify connection string is being set (truncated version will be logged)
3. Test authentication endpoints to confirm database connectivity
