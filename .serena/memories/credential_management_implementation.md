# Credential Management Implementation - Completed

## Date: 2025-09-08

## Implemented Features

### 1. Environment-Specific Configuration
- Created .env template files for Development, Staging, and Production
- Each environment has its own isolated configuration
- Templates include all necessary environment variables with placeholders

### 2. Secure Credential Storage
- Updated .gitignore to exclude all .env files (except templates)
- Sensitive credentials are never committed to the repository
- Environment variables are loaded at runtime from .env files

### 3. Application Configuration
- Modified Program.cs to use DotNetEnv package for loading environment variables
- Updated appsettings files to use environment variable placeholders with fallbacks
- Connection strings and API keys now use ${ENV_VAR:-default} syntax

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflows
- Created separate workflow files for Development, Staging, and Production
- Each workflow deploys to its respective environment
- Workflows triggered by pushes to corresponding branches

### 5. Railway Configuration
- Added railway.staging.json and railway.production.json for deployment
- Each environment has its own Railway project configuration
- Automated deployments configured through GitHub integration

## Key Files Modified
- WebAPI/Program.cs - Added DotNetEnv integration
- WebAPI/appsettings.Development.json - Environment variable placeholders
- WebAPI/appsettings.Staging.json - Environment variable placeholders
- .gitignore - Updated to exclude .env files properly

## Next Steps
1. Configure actual Railway projects for staging and production
2. Set up environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. Test automated deployments through GitHub Actions
4. Create branch protection rules for master branch

## Important Notes
- Always copy .env.*.template files to .env.* and fill with actual values
- Never commit actual .env files
- Use Railway dashboard to manage production secrets
- All environments now isolated with their own credentials
