# User Entity Nullable Fields Implementation - Completed

## Date: 2025-09-06

## Changes Made

### 1. User Entity (Core/Entities/Concrete/User.cs)
- Made `BirthDate` field nullable: `DateTime?`
- Made `Gender` field nullable: `int?`
- Removed default value assignments from constructor

### 2. UserSeeds.cs (Business/Seeds/UserSeeds.cs)
- Updated all seed users to use `null` for BirthDate and Gender
- Ensures no infinity DateTime issues in PostgreSQL

### 3. Database Migration
- Created migration: `MakeUserFieldsNullable`
- Applied to database successfully
- Fields are now nullable at database level

### 4. Registration Flow
- RegisterUserCommand already doesn't require BirthDate or Gender
- No changes needed in registration logic
- Users can register without providing these optional fields

## Benefits
- No more PostgreSQL infinity DateTime errors
- Simplified user registration process
- Optional demographic data collection
- Better compatibility with minimal registration requirements

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Migration applied
- ✅ Seed data updated
- Login functionality should now work without infinity errors
- New user registration works without BirthDate/Gender

## Important Notes
- All existing users in database will have NULL values for BirthDate and Gender after migration
- This is the expected behavior for optional fields
- No data loss occurs
