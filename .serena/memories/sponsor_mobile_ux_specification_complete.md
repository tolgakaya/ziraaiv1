- Real-time progress for bulk operations
- Confirmation dialogs for critical actions

### 3. Data Visualization
- Charts for trends, color-coded badges
- Progress bars, comparative views

### 4. Mobile-First Design

- Adjustable text size
- Screen reader support

## Technical Integration Notes

### Code Flow Understanding
Documented complete sponsor code lifecycle:
1. **Purchase:** Sponsor buys package â†’ Codes auto-generated
2. **Generation:** Format `PREFIX-YEAR-RANDOMXXXX` (unique collision check)
3. **Distribution:** SMS/WhatsApp with redemption links
4. **Redemption:** Farmer uses code â†’ Subscription created
5. **Tracking:** Complete analytics funnel

### Privacy Implementation
Tier-based data visibility rules:

- M: City only, no personal contact info
- S: Minimal location, anonymous farmer

### API Response Patterns
- Success/error message structure
