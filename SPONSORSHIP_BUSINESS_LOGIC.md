## Tier-Based Business Logic

### Tier Structure Rationale

#### S Tier (Small) - Entry Level
**Target Market**: Small agricultural suppliers, local cooperatives, startups  
**Business Purpose**: Market entry, brand awareness, data collection  
**Price Point**: ₺99.99/month (low barrier to entry)

**Feature Justification**:
- **30% Data Access**: Sufficient for basic market research and trend analysis
- **Logo Visibility**: Brand exposure on analysis results
- **No Messaging**: Prevents spam, encourages tier upgrades
- **No Profile Access**: Protects farmer privacy at entry level

#### M Tier (Medium) - Market Research
**Target Market**: Regional suppliers, research institutions, market analysts  
**Business Purpose**: Market research, trend analysis, anonymous farmer insights  
**Price Point**: ₺299.99/month (3x S tier for 3x value)

**Feature Justification**:
- **30% Data Access**: Same as S tier (price increase for profile access)
- **Anonymous Profile Access**: Demographic insights without privacy concerns
- **No Direct Messaging**: Maintains farmer privacy while providing market data
- **Logo Visibility**: Continued brand exposure

#### L Tier (Large) - Engagement Platform
**Target Market**: Major suppliers, agricultural corporations, cooperative federations  
**Business Purpose**: Direct farmer engagement, technical support, lead generation  
**Price Point**: ₺599.99/month (2x M tier for communication + profile access)

**Feature Justification**:
- **60% Data Access**: Substantial data for serious business decisions
- **Full Farmer Profiles**: Complete farmer information for targeted support
- **Direct Messaging**: Two-way communication for technical support and sales
- **Smart Linking**: Advanced marketing and engagement tools

- **Custom Integrations**: API access and custom dashboard development

### Feature Correlation Logic

#### Messaging ↔ Profile Access Correlation
**Business Rationale**: Companies that can message farmers should see full profiles to provide relevant, personalized support.

**Implementation Logic**:
```
IF tier has messaging capability (L/XL) 
THEN tier has full profile access
ELSE tier has limited/no profile access
```

**Benefits**:
- **For Sponsors**: Meaningful farmer engagement requires complete farmer context
- **For Farmers**: Messages from sponsors who understand their specific situation
- **For Platform**: Clear upgrade incentive and logical feature progression

#### Data Access Percentage Strategy
**Business Rationale**: Progressive data access encourages tier upgrades while preventing data dumps at lower tiers.

**Percentage Justification**:
- **S/M Tiers (30%)**: Sufficient for basic insights, not enough for competitive advantage
- **L Tier (60%)**: Substantial business intelligence, clear value for premium price
- **XL Tier (100%)**: Complete market intelligence justifies premium pricing

## Revenue Optimization Model

### Package-Based Purchasing Logic

#### Bulk Code Generation Strategy
**Business Model**: Sponsors purchase packages of redemption codes in bulk

**Revenue Benefits**:
- **Upfront Revenue**: Immediate cash flow from bulk purchases
- **Inventory Management**: Sponsors manage their own code distribution
- **Scalability**: No per-transaction processing overhead
- **Predictable Revenue**: Sponsors commit to specific farmer volumes

#### Pricing Psychology
**Price Points Designed For**:
- **S Tier**: Low commitment, trial adoption, word-of-mouth marketing
- **M Tier**: Serious market research, mid-size company budgets
- **L Tier**: Enterprise solutions, ROI-focused pricing
- **XL Tier**: Premium positioning, comprehensive solutions

### Customer Acquisition Funnel

## Decision-Making Algorithms

### Tier Access Validation Logic

#### Service Access Algorithm
```csharp
public bool CanAccessService(string serviceName, string tierName)
{
    var tierLevel = GetTierLevel(tierName); // S=1, M=2, L=3, XL=4
    
    return serviceName switch
    {
        "BasicAnalytics" => tierLevel >= 1,     // All tiers
        "LogoVisibility" => tierLevel >= 1,     // All tiers
        "SmartLinking" => tierLevel >= 1,       // All tiers
        "AnonymousProfiles" => tierLevel >= 2,  // M, L, XL
        "DirectMessaging" => tierLevel >= 3,    // L, XL only
        "FullProfiles" => tierLevel >= 3,       // L, XL only
        "CompleteDataAccess" => tierLevel >= 4, // XL only
        _ => false
    };
}
```

#### Data Access Calculation
```csharp
public decimal GetDataAccessPercentage(string tierName)
{
    return tierName switch
    {
        "S" => 0.30m,   // 30%
        "M" => 0.30m,   // 30%
        "L" => 0.60m,   // 60%
        "XL" => 1.00m,  // 100%
        _ => 0.00m      // No access
    };
}
```

### Purchase Validation Logic

#### Code Generation Business Rules
```csharp
public class CodeGenerationRules
{
    public const int MinCodesPerPurchase = 1;
    public const int MaxCodesPerPurchase = 1000;
    public const int DefaultValidityDays = 365;
    public const int MaxValidityDays = 1095; // 3 years
    
    public bool ValidatePurchase(int quantity, decimal amount, string tierName)
    {
        var expectedAmount = CalculateExpectedAmount(quantity, tierName);
        var tolerance = 0.01m; // 1% tolerance for currency conversion
        
        return quantity >= MinCodesPerPurchase &&
               quantity <= MaxCodesPerPurchase &&
               Math.Abs(amount - expectedAmount) <= tolerance;
    }
}
```

## Business Rules Engine

### Farmer Profile Visibility Rules

#### Privacy Protection Algorithm
```csharp
public FarmerProfile ApplyPrivacyFilter(FarmerProfile originalProfile, string sponsorTier)
{
    return sponsorTier switch
    {
        "S" => null, // No access
        "M" => new FarmerProfile // Anonymous access
        {
            FarmerId = "F***",
            Region = originalProfile.Region,
            CropTypes = originalProfile.CropTypes,
            FarmSize = GetSizeRange(originalProfile.FarmSize),
            ExperienceLevel = originalProfile.ExperienceLevel,
            // Remove: Name, Email, Phone, Exact Location
        },
        "L" or "XL" => originalProfile, // Full access
        _ => null
    };
}
```

### Message Routing Logic

#### Communication Business Rules
```csharp
public class MessageRoutingRules
{
    public bool CanSendMessage(string sponsorTier, int messageCount, DateTime lastMessage)
    {
        var tierLimits = new Dictionary<string, (int daily, int monthly)>
        {
            ["L"] = (10, 100),   // L tier: 10 daily, 100 monthly
            ["XL"] = (50, 500)   // XL tier: 50 daily, 500 monthly
        };
        
        if (!tierLimits.ContainsKey(sponsorTier))
            return false; // S/M tiers cannot message
            
        // Additional rate limiting and spam prevention logic
        return ValidateRateLimits(sponsorTier, messageCount, lastMessage);
    }
}
```
